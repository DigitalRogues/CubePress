# CubePress
CubePress is a swift application that allows for users to interface with their CUBOTino using an iPhone via remote network. It is intended for use in tandem with the [CUBOTino project](https://github.com/AndreaFavero71/CUBOTino_base_version).

The CUBOTino is a fascinating open source robot that solves Rubix cubes, and CubePress is a project that seeks to make the CUBOTino far more portable! With CubePress, users can create a portable version of the CUBOTino, and take photos of their cubes using the camera on their iPhone.
