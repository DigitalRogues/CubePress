# CubePress
CubePress is a swift applictaion that allows for users to remotely interface with their CUBOTino using an iPhone via remote network. It is intended for use in tandem with the [CUBOTino project](https://github.com/AndreaFavero71/CUBOTino_base_version).

The CUBOTino is a fascinating robot that solves Rubix cubes, and CubePress is an application that makes CUBOTino far more portable! With CubePress, users can take photos of their cubes using the camera on their iPhone, rather than needing to use a pc and a web cam like before.
